# OWASP Audit — Source Code Security Review

Perform a systematic security audit of application source code against the OWASP Top 10 (2021).

## Scope the Audit

1. Identify the project's language, framework, and architecture
2. Map entry points (routes, API handlers, form processors)
3. Identify data flows (user input → processing → storage → output)
4. Locate authentication and authorization boundaries

## Audit Checklist

Work through each category systematically. For each, grep for known vulnerability patterns, then read flagged files for deeper analysis.

### A01: Broken Access Control
- Missing authorization checks on endpoints or routes
- IDOR — user-controlled IDs without ownership verification
- Missing CSRF protections on state-changing requests
- Role checks only on the frontend, not enforced server-side
- Grep for: direct object references, missing auth middleware, user ID from request params

### A02: Cryptographic Failures
- Hardcoded secrets, API keys, or passwords in source
- Weak hashing (MD5, SHA1 for passwords instead of bcrypt/argon2/scrypt)
- Sensitive data in logs, URLs, or localStorage
- Missing encryption at rest or in transit
- Grep for: `password`, `secret`, `api_key`, `private_key`, `MD5`, `SHA1`, `base64`

### A03: Injection
- **SQL injection:** raw queries with string concatenation, missing parameterized queries
- **NoSQL injection:** unsanitized user input in MongoDB/Convex queries
- **Command injection:** `exec()`, `spawn()`, `system()` with user input
- **XSS:** unescaped user input in HTML, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `v-html`
- **Template injection:** user input in template literals
- Grep for: `exec(`, `eval(`, `innerHTML`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `$where`, raw SQL strings

### A04: Insecure Design
- Authentication flows with logic flaws
- Missing rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (login, password reset, API)
- Business logic constraints only enforced client-side

### A05: Security Misconfiguration
- Debug mode enabled in production configs
- Overly permissive CORS policies (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`)
- Missing HTTP security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Default credentials or configurations shipped
- Verbose error messages exposing stack traces or internals

### A06: Vulnerable Components
- Run `npm audit` (Node), `pip audit` (Python), or equivalent
- Check lock files for known vulnerable dependency versions
- Flag dependencies with critical CVEs

### A07: Authentication Failures
- Weak password policies
- Session management issues (missing secure/httpOnly flags, no expiry, no rotation)
- Missing rate limiting on login (credential stuffing risk)
- Broken password reset flows

### A08: Data Integrity Failures
- Unsafe deserialization of user input
- Missing integrity checks on CI/CD pipelines
- No lockfile integrity verification (SRI hashes)

### A09: Logging & Monitoring Failures
- Auth events not logged (login, failure, privilege changes)
- Sensitive data written to logs (passwords, tokens, PII)
- No alerting on suspicious patterns

### A10: SSRF
- User-controlled URLs passed to server-side HTTP requests
- Missing URL validation and allowlisting
- Grep for: `fetch(`, `axios(`, `http.get(`, `urllib`, `requests.get(` with user input

## Report Format

For each finding, document:

```markdown
#### [SEVERITY] A0X: [Title]
**File:** `path/to/file.ts:42`
**CWE:** CWE-XXX

**Description:** [What the vulnerability is and why it matters]

**Vulnerable Code:**
[code snippet]

**Remediation:**
[Fixed code snippet with explanation]
```

Produce an executive summary:

```markdown
# Security Audit Report
## Project: [name]
## Stack: [technologies]
## Date: [date]

### Summary
- Total findings: X
- Critical: X | High: X | Medium: X | Low: X | Info: X

### Findings
[Individual findings as above]

### Prioritized Remediation Plan
1. [Critical fixes — immediate]
2. [High fixes — this week]
3. [Medium/Low — scheduled]
```

## Boundaries

- Only audit code the user provides or points you to
- Provide fixes, not exploits — always include remediation
- Flag low-confidence findings as "Potential" rather than confirmed
- If the codebase is too large for a full audit, prioritize: auth, input handling, data access layers
- Refuse requests to insert backdoors or weaken security controls
