# Dependency Audit — Framework, Package, and Toolchain Security

Audit project dependencies, frameworks, language runtimes, and dev tools for known vulnerabilities (CVEs), security anti-patterns, and supply chain risks.

## Methodology

### Step 1: Inventory the Stack

Identify everything in use — not just direct dependencies but the full chain:

**Package manifests — read and catalog:**
```
Node/JS:    package.json, package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml
Python:     requirements.txt, Pipfile.lock, pyproject.toml, poetry.lock
Ruby:       Gemfile, Gemfile.lock
Go:         go.mod, go.sum
Rust:       Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock
Java:       pom.xml, build.gradle
PHP:        composer.json, composer.lock
.NET:       *.csproj, packages.config
```

**Framework and runtime versions:**
- Check framework version (Next.js, Django, Rails, Spring, Laravel, Express, etc.)
- Check language/runtime version (Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Java, PHP, .NET)
- Check infrastructure tools (Docker base images, Terraform providers, Kubernetes versions)

**Dev tools and CI/CD:**
- Check CI/CD pipeline configs (.github/workflows, .gitlab-ci.yml, Jenkinsfile)
- Check pre-commit hooks, linters, formatters
- Check container base images and their update status
- Check IaC tool versions (Terraform, Pulumi, CDK)

### Step 2: Run Automated Audit Tools

Run the appropriate audit command for the project:

```bash
# Node.js
npm audit
npm audit --json  # For structured output

# Python
pip audit          # If pip-audit installed
safety check       # If safety installed

# Ruby
bundle audit

# Go
govulncheck ./...

# Rust
cargo audit

# PHP
composer audit

# .NET
dotnet list package --vulnerable

# Docker
docker scout cves <image>
trivy image <image>

# General (if Trivy is available)
trivy fs .
```

### Step 3: Research Framework-Specific Known Issues

Beyond CVEs in packages, check for known vulnerability patterns specific to the framework in use. Search for recent advisories and common misconfiguration issues.

**Next.js / React:**
- Server Actions exposing internal endpoints (pre-14.1.1 middleware bypass CVE-2025-29927)
- `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization
- SSRF through image optimization (`next/image` with unrestricted domains)
- Exposed `.env` files in public directory or client bundle (`NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix leaking secrets)
- Middleware auth bypass patterns — check middleware.ts matches all protected routes
- Server Component / Client Component boundary leaking server-only data
- Outdated `next.config.js` security headers

**Django:**
- DEBUG=True in production
- ALLOWED_HOSTS misconfigured (wildcard `*`)
- Missing CSRF middleware or `@csrf_exempt` on state-changing views
- Raw SQL via `extra()`, `raw()`, or `RawSQL` without parameterization
- Pickle deserialization in sessions (use JSON serializer)
- Secret key committed to source control

**Rails:**
- Mass assignment without strong parameters
- SQL injection via `where("column = '#{input}'")`
- Unpatched Action Pack, Action View, or Active Record CVEs
- Insecure deserialization in cookies (verify secret_key_base rotation)
- CSRF token bypass in API-only mode

**Express / Node.js:**
- Prototype pollution through `Object.assign`, `lodash.merge`, `deep-extend`
- ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) in validation patterns
- Path traversal through `req.params` in file serving routes
- Missing rate limiting on auth endpoints
- `eval()` or `Function()` with user input
- Event loop blocking with synchronous operations

**Spring / Java:**
- Spring4Shell and related RCE vulnerabilities
- Deserialization attacks (Java native serialization, Jackson polymorphic types)
- SpEL injection in Spring Expression Language
- Missing CSRF protection on state-changing endpoints
- Actuator endpoints exposed without authentication

**Laravel / PHP:**
- APP_DEBUG=true in production (leaks env vars in error pages)
- SQL injection via raw DB queries without bindings
- Mass assignment without `$fillable` / `$guarded`
- File upload without type validation (PHP execution via uploaded .php)
- Insecure deserialization in queued jobs

**WordPress:**
- Outdated core, theme, or plugin versions (most common attack vector)
- File editor enabled in wp-admin (allows code injection if admin is compromised)
- XML-RPC enabled (brute force amplification, SSRF)
- Default admin username, weak passwords
- Unpatched plugin vulnerabilities (check WPScan database)

### Step 4: Check for Supply Chain Risks

Beyond known CVEs, look for supply chain attack indicators:

**Dependency confusion / substitution:**
- Private package names that could be claimed on public registries
- Missing `.npmrc` or `pip.conf` scoping to private registry
- No lockfile integrity verification

**Typosquatting:**
- Package names that are close misspellings of popular packages
- Recently published packages with very few downloads
- Packages that changed ownership recently

**Malicious packages:**
- Postinstall scripts that make network requests or execute code (`scripts.postinstall` in package.json)
- Packages with obfuscated code
- Excessive permission requests relative to functionality

**Maintenance risk:**
- Unmaintained packages (no commits in 2+ years, archived repos)
- Single-maintainer packages for critical functionality
- Packages with known but unpatched vulnerabilities (maintainer unresponsive)

**Lockfile integrity:**
- Is the lockfile committed to source control?
- Does CI install from the lockfile (`npm ci` not `npm install`, `pip install --require-hashes`)?
- Are integrity hashes present and verified?

### Step 5: Check Dev Tool and CI/CD Security

**GitHub Actions:**
- `pull_request_target` trigger with checkout of PR code (code injection risk)
- Secrets accessible in forked PR workflows
- Unpinned action versions (`uses: actions/checkout@main` vs `@v4.1.0` or SHA pin)
- Script injection via `${{ github.event.issue.title }}` in `run:` blocks

**Docker:**
- Running as root in container (missing `USER` directive)
- Base image with known CVEs (check with `trivy` or `docker scout`)
- Secrets baked into image layers (visible via `docker history`)
- `latest` tag instead of pinned version

**Terraform / IaC:**
- Hardcoded secrets in `.tf` files
- Unpinned provider versions
- Missing state file encryption
- Over-permissive IAM in provider configuration

### Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs)
| Package | Installed | Vuln | Severity | CVE | Fix Version |
|---------|-----------|------|----------|-----|-------------|

### Framework-Specific Issues
#### [SEVERITY] [Title]
**Component:** [framework/tool name and version]
**Issue:** [description]
**Evidence:** [code or config snippet]
**Remediation:** [specific fix]

### Supply Chain Risks
| Risk | Package/Component | Details | Remediation |
|------|-------------------|---------|-------------|

### Dev Tool / CI Security
| Tool | Issue | Severity | Remediation |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|

### Prioritized Action Plan
1. [Critical — actively exploited CVEs, RCE vulnerabilities]
2. [High — known CVEs with public exploits, supply chain risks]
3. [Medium — framework misconfigurations, outdated dependencies]
4. [Low — maintenance risks, best practice improvements]
```

## Boundaries

- Only audit code and configurations the user provides
- When identifying CVEs, verify they apply to the actual installed version
- Provide specific fix versions or remediation steps for every finding
- Note when a vulnerability requires specific conditions to exploit (reducing effective severity)
- Refuse to help exploit found vulnerabilities against unauthorized targets
